# tfLabs
my terraform labs
Requirements :
 - terraform installed
 - openstack CLI installed

See each folder for custom setup

NOTICE : If you run into problems requiring you to run "terraform apply" twice or more, it is likely some depends_on are missing. Pay special attention to the implicit/explicit dependency mechanism.

Have fun!
