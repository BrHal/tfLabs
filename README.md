# tfLabs
my terraform labs
Requirements :
 - terraform installed
 - openstack CLI installed

See each folder for custom setup

NOTICE : terraform parallelism may still be buggy.
If you run into problems requiring you to run "terraform apply" twice or more,
try "terraform apply -parallelism=1"

Have fun!
